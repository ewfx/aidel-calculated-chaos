# Transaction Screening Test Cases

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the test cases used to validate the transaction screening process. The system evaluates financial transactions against global sanctions lists, news sources, and regulatory filings to assess potential risks. Each transaction undergoes a series of checks, including:

1. **OFAC US and UN Sanctions Screening** - Verifying if entities involved in the transaction appear on the sanctions lists.
2. **News API Risk Assessment** - Analyzing news data for any negative associations with the transaction participants.
3. **SEC EDGAR Filings Review** - Checking for financial irregularities in company filings.
4. **LLM-Based Risk Scoring** - Assigning a final risk score based on extracted data and contextual risk factors.
